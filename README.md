# Grid-GAN
Preprocessing code for machine learning models learning a segmentation framework for several segmentation precisions. 
The machine learning models will soon be published as well.

The preprocessing code involves a framework for learning machine learning models to segment within several segmentation precisions.
The framework and preprocessing of the code involves augmenting datasets with grid information pertaining to our grid segmentation framework. 
This was implemented in C++ as initial experiments were computationally demanding.
See thesis for more details regarding the overall framework.
