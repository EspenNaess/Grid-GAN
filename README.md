# Grid-GAN
Framework and models to learn several segmentation precisions. Models will soon be published.

The framework and preprocessing of the code involves augmenting datasets with grid information pertaining to our grid segmentation framework. 
This was implemented in C++ as initial experiments were computationally demanding.
See thesis for more details regarding the overall framework.
